        Rmdir'ed Graphic.
        Renamed the .pro file.
        Fixed a few typos in comments.
        Tidied up a few files.
        None of the above changes should affect Graphic in any functional way.

        basicgraphs.cpp: fixed scaling of internal polygon of antiprisms
        so that it scales according to both height and width.

        node.cpp: Modify setWeight(QString) so that it uses cmr10 if the
           string is numeric.  This function is (apparently) called by the
           callback in labelcontroller.cpp when a user edits a label.
        edge.cpp: fix edge label font (cmmi and cmr were reversed).
        canvasview.cpp: change the help text for join (JOIN_DESCRIPTION)
           to clarify usage.

	label.cpp: Created method setLabel(QString string) 
	The argument, string, is examined and the font changes if a 
	character is a letter or a number. 
	Changes should be made to the node.cpp and mainwindow.ui so 
	the user can decide if they want node labels to have a subscript
	or not.
